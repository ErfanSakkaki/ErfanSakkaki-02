      <p class="bio">
        Hayo All, I am a YouTuber and Web Developer. I've been a gamer since 1994 and literally learned my skills by playing video games. <br />
        I love playing üïπÔ∏è video games and make my own content. </p>

        <h3 class="survivor">I am a SURVIVOR</h3>
        <p class="survivortext">
          I made over 400 videos in my native language, starting with Persian gaming/video-sharing websites before switching to the English community. I'm a one-man army in my career because I haven't found people who invest their heart and time into the job as much as I have yet. So I learned to rely on myself and fight my way in the most struggling times of life.

        <h3 class="king">King of NO MERCY</h3>
        <p class="kingtext">
          I'm popular for being a caring person among my older fans as well as "King of No Mercy." Actually, I just made up the second one because they haven't seen The Evil within part of my character yet. To be more clear, my best skill is in beating people in family video games. Cheers to the whole kingdom!</p>
